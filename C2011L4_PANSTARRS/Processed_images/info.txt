Each image was processed through IDL. 

The processed variables, including the final solar wind velocity results are stored as individual .sav files for each image. 

The .sav files are stored under the observer location. Only STEREO B data was successfully analysed for comet C/2011 L4 (PANSTARRS).

To produce a plot, the solar wind velocities must be obtained from each image OR use the concatenated solar wind velocities in the SW_results directory.
