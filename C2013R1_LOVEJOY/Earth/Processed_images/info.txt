Each image was processed through IDL. 

The processed variables, including the final solar wind velocity results are stored as individual .sav files for each image. 

The .sav files are stored under the observer location. Only data from Earth was successfully analysed for comet C/2013 R1 (PANSTARRS).

Images were obtained from amateur astronomers and Y.Ramanjooloo (author) and K. Birkett from the Isaac Newton Telescope for the analysis.

To produce a plot, the solar wind velocities must be obtained from each image **OR** use the concatenated solar wind velocities in the SW_results directory. 
This is not currently available for C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy) but will be made available soon.
